## Title
Employee Attrition Prediction with Randomized Grid Search and Decision Trees
Aim: Develop a predictive model using decision trees and optimize hyperparameters with Randomized Grid Search to identify potential employee attrition in a company.
Description: This GitHub repository contains code and data for building a decision tree-based model to predict employee attrition. The model is trained on a dataset that includes various employee attributes, such as job role, department, salary, and performance ratings. Additionally, the repository showcases the use of Randomized Grid Search to optimize hyperparameters for the decision tree model, enhancing its predictive accuracy.

## Target Audience
This repository is intended for data scientists, machine learning practitioners, or anyone interested in employee attrition prediction using decision trees and hyperparameter tuning. It provides a practical example of applying decision tree algorithms, along with Randomized Grid Search, for classification tasks.

## Conclusion
By incorporating Randomized Grid Search, the decision tree model achieves improved accuracy in predicting employee attrition. The optimized hyperparameters enhance the model's ability to capture complex relationships within the data and provide more reliable predictions. The repository includes the complete code, dataset, instructions for running the code, and additional documentation for a comprehensive understanding of the implementation and results.
